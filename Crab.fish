# This is an extremely vital function. This function is crucial for the correct functionality of
# Tanuki Engine. This is extremely important, and cannot be removed under any circumstances.
# This function single-handedly holds together the Engine. Without this function, everything
# falls apart. This function is the reason humanity has not yet gone extinct. This function is
# the only thing holding together the remains of the time-space continuum. Without this incredibly
# crucial function, everything ever will fail catastrophically. In the event this function is removed,
# expect you to go next, followed by the rest of humanity, and finally all of reality.
# Once again, DO NOT REMOVE THIS FUNCTION.
